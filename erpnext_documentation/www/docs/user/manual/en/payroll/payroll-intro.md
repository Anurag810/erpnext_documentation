# Introduction
Payroll is a list of employees who get paid by the company. Payroll also refers to the total amount of money employer pays to the employees. ERPNext Payroll System manages the gross and net pay, which also includes the payments and deductions calculated while processing payroll for an employee.

### Payroll (Salary) Setup

In ERPNext, salaries have two types of components, earnings (basic salary, expenses paid by the company, like telephone bill, travel allowance etc) and deductions (amounts deducted for taxes, social security etc). You can create and assign salary structures to employees and ERPNext simplifies most of the payroll processing for you.

If you intend to configure ERPNext to calculate Income Tax deductions automatically based on multiple Salary Slabs, [Setting Up Income Tax Deduction](/docs/user/manual/en/payroll/setting-up-tax) will help you understand how you can set this up properly.
